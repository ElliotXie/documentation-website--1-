title: RAG (Optional)
---

While the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent significantly enhances annotation accuracy in complex or literature-scarce settings, it is currently implemented only in the Python version of the CASSIA package. 

This is due to dependency limitations. We recognize the importance of providing parity across platforms and are actively working to bring the RAG agent to the R package as soon as possible.
