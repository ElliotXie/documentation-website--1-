title: Compare Cell Types (Optional)
---


This function allows you to determine which cell type is most likely to be the true cell type of a cluster, utilizing multiple LLMs. Under default settings, 3 state-of-the-art LLMs are used to score the candidate cell types based on the marker genes.


## Function Parameters

```r
compareCelltypes(
    tissue,        # The tissue type being analyzed (e.g., "large intestine")
    celltypes,     # Vector of cell types to compare (e.g., c("Plasma Cells", "IgA-secreting Plasma Cells"))
    marker,        # String of marker genes separated by commas
    species,       # Species of origin ("human" or "mouse")
    output_file,   # Name for the output file (e.g., "plasma_cell_subtype")
    model_list     # Optional: List of LLM models to use (has default values)
)
```

## Parameter Details

- `tissue`: Specifies the tissue source of your data (e.g., "large intestine", "small intestine", "brain")

- `celltypes`: List of cell types you want to compare (maximum recommended: 4-5). Example: `c("Plasma Cells", "IgA-secreting Plasma Cells", "IgG-secreting Plasma Cells")`

- `marker`: Comma-separated list of marker genes (e.g., "IGLL5, IGLV6-57, JCHAIN, FAM92B, IGLC3")

- `species`: Specifies the species origin of your data

- `output_file`: Name for the output file (without extension)

- `model_list`: Optional parameter. Default models (if none provided) are state-of-the-art LLMs:
  ```r
  model_list = c(
      "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",  # Anthropic's latest model
      "openai/o1-mini",              # OpenAI's model
      "google/gemini-pro-1.5"        # Google's model
  )
  ```



## Output Format

1. **Console Output**:
   - Similarity scores from each LLM for each cell type
   - Consensus results (if reached)
   - Warning messages (if any)

2. **Output File** (saved as "[output_file].txt"):
   - Detailed comparison results from each LLM
   - Marker gene analysis
   - Final consensus (if reached)

## Interpretation Guide

### High Confidence Result
- A high confidence result is obtained when ALL LLMs give a score above 80% for the same cell type
- This indicates a clear, unambiguous cell type identification

### No Consensus Reached
If no clear consensus is reached, consider these possible scenarios:

1. **Low Quality Cluster**
   - Symptom: Inconsistent or low scores across LLMs
   - Solution: Increase the number of marker genes in your analysis

2. **Mixed Cluster**
   - Symptom: Different LLMs strongly favor different cell types
   - Solution: Perform subclustering to separate potential distinct populations

3. **Last Resort**
   - If issues persist after trying the above solutions
   - Consult domain experts for manual review
